# InnerLeaf - Grow Your Mental Health Like a Plant

InnerLeaf is a gamified mental-wellness platform where your mental health becomes a living digital garden. Every positive action you take in real life helps your virtual plant grow and thrive — creating a deep emotional connection and building long-term healthy habits.

## 🌱 Core Concept

Users perform real-world self-care tasks (like journaling, meditating, exercising, drinking water, etc.) → the system rewards them by:

- Growing their digital plant
- Unlocking new leaves, colors, and shapes
- Upgrading their pot
- Earning XP + in-game coins

Skipping self-care → plant shows signs of stress:

- Leaves turn pale
- Growth slows down
- Soil cracks

This visual feedback gently motivates users without guilt-tripping.

## 🍃 Features

### 1. Personalized Plant Garden
- Choose from 5 plant types (Lotus, Fern, Bonsai, Cactus, Lavender)
- Select from 3 garden themes (Calm Forest, Cosmic Garden, Cozy Room)
- Each plant species represents a mental trait:
  - Lotus → mindfulness
  - Cactus → resilience
  - Bonsai → discipline
  - Lavender → stress relief

### 2. Daily Mental Quests
- Get 3–5 short mental wellness tasks each day:
  - "Breathe deeply for 30 seconds"
  - "Write one thing you're grateful for"
  - "Drink a glass of water"
  - "Take a 3-minute break from screens"
- Completing quests = Plant growth + rewards

### 3. Habit Tracker
- Add personal habits:
  - Sleep before 11 pm
  - Study for 1 hour
  - No social media for 1 hour
  - Read 10 pages
- Each completed habit gives Sunshine points 🌞 and Water points 💧 to feed the plant

### 4. Seasonal Mind Challenges
- Monthly challenges:
  - Winter Calm Challenge
  - Spring Growth Challenge
  - Summer Motivation Quest
- Completing all days unlocks:
  - ✨ Rare plants
  - ✨ Exclusive pots
  - ✨ Special backgrounds
